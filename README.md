# Tableau_Data_Visualization_Project
1. Create a Database 

Let’s start by creating a database in MySQL or (SQL
Server Management Studio) for further analysis of Hotel Booking Data. For this project 
I have used MySQL.

2. Querying data

We have now prepared our data tables in the database for SQL commands. 
Let’s now apply some commands to explore the data. For this I have attached the SQL file.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Now, we are going to apply EDA on the data and try answer the following questions.

Is our hotel revenue growing yearly?
Should we increase our parking lot size?
What trends can we see in the data?

4. Conclusion
In this Project, I have used Tableau Visualization to find out the below conclusion.

a)Revenue increased from 2018 to 2019, but it began to decrease from 2019 to 2020.
b)The average daily rate (ADR) has increased from 2019 to 2020, from $99.53 to $104.47.
c)Total number of nights booked by customers decreased from 2019 to 2020.
d)The discount percentage offered by the hotel has increased from 2019 to 2020 to 
attract more customers.
